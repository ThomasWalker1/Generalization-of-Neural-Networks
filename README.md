# Generalization-of-Neural-Networks

This repository contains the code for an undergraduate research project I conducted in the summer of 2023. The projects looks into the current state of theory regarding the generalization of deep neural networks. Throughout the repository the generalization bounds proposed by various papers are tested and investigated. Furthermore, some of the work is my own work that extends the concepts in the papers and links them together in a concise and coherent manner. The aim of the project is to understand how current literature intertwines to gives us an understanding on how deep neural networks generalize.
